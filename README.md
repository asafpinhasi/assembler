# assembler

The project is an assembler for an imaginary computer. The assembler receives input, checks it's validity, and tranlate it into machine language. 
The assembler works in two passes - the first check the input's validity and saves the labels, 
and the second codes the instructives and directives of the commands into machine laguage. 
For elaborate information about the assembly language and the task you can read here - https://github.com/asafpinhasi/assembler/blob/main/C%20project%20instructions.pdf.

An example of valid input for the assembler:
